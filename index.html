<h1 align="center">Method Overloading Example in Java Class</h1>

<p id="lead">These are some methods that I made in the Java class that I'm taking on Udemy. These methods convert feet into inches
and inches into centimeters. I found these exercises to be quite challenging and helpful in my journey as a web developer. I hope
that you all enjoy!</p>

I've worked with a bunch of developers on projects and have helped build pages for small business owners across the city of Birmingham.</h4>
